## TabView Content
<pre>
<img align="left" src="Previews/TabView-Content.png" width="250">

### Logic 
> Implemented 5 different tabs for single TabView.<br/>
> Collection of the data is based on hardcoded values inside the model structs (without mock or real Api calls).<br/>
> Implemented QR code scanner screen with some fake result instead of real verification. Account and Tickets data are taken from the same source.<br/>
> Logout screen is implemented with discard BarView from the Navigation stack and return to Initial screen.<br/>
> Base tab for TabView is the first one that is defined in the code.
